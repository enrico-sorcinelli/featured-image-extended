# Featured Image Extended

Feature Image Extended extends featured image functionality allowing:

* Hiding featured image in your themes for all post types.
* Adding link to the featured image.
* Adding thumbnail featured image in administration screens listing.
* Featured image quick-editing.

# Installation

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/featured-image-extended` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress _Plugins_ screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the _Plugins_ screen in WordPress.

# Usage

Once the plugin is installed you can configure it in the following ways:

* Using the _Settings->Featured Image Extended_ administration screen.
* Programmatically, by using `featured_image_extended_settings` filter (see below).

If your theme uses a different call other than `the_post_thumbnail()`/`get_the_post_thumbnail()` in order to get the featured image, this plugin might not work.
So, in order to get extended featured image settings and apply to your pages, you should use `featured_image_extended()` (see below).

# API

### `featured_image_extended( integer $post_id = null )`

It returns an array containing featured image extended information of `$post_id` post (or current post if you don't supply an argument) like following:

```
array(
	'show'   => true,
	'url'    => 'https://myurl.com',
	'target' => '_blank',
	'title'  => 'Image title',
)
```

## Hooks

### `featured_image_extended_settings`

Filters plugin settings values.

```php
apply_filters( 'featured_image_extended_settings', array $settings )
```

### `featured_image_extended_admin_settings`

Filter allowing to display or not the plugin settings page in the administration.

```php
apply_filters( 'featured_image_extended_admin_settings', boolean $display )
```

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Does it work with Gutenberg?

Not completely. For setting visibility of featured image, this plugin uses `admin_post_thumbnail_html` filter and currently there are no Gutenberg equivalents.
